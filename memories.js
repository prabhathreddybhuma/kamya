    <p>Hey baby,</p>
    <p>I guess this was more me than writing a handwritten letter. I wanted to do something creative something I could actually build for you something that felt like me. I didn’t want this to be something you just read once and put away. I wanted it to be something you could come back to, something that stays. I really hope you liked it.</p>
    <p>I love you so, so much, sweetheart. I’ve probably told you a thousand times already, and I know I’ll say it a thousand more without ever getting tired of it. You are everything I ever wanted, and more than I even knew how to ask for. I’m so grateful that I met you, and even more grateful that I get to love you. You are genuinely the sweetest person I’ve ever known, and every day you make my life feel a little softer.</p>
    <p>I know it hasn’t been very long just a few months but somehow you’ve already become such a deep, irreplaceable part of my life. You’re part of my routines now, part of my thoughts. I honestly can’t imagine a future without you in it. Whenever I think about what’s ahead, I see you, walking beside me, hand in hand. You’re locked in with me. I’m not letting you go anywhere. You’re mine and you’ll be mine forever. I choose you, again and again.</p>
    <p>I know it’s going to be really hard for both of us when I move to a completely different country. I don’t know how life will be there, what I’ll do, or how things will feel. But one thing I’m absolutely sure about is us. No matter the distance, we’ll stay together. I promise I’ll put in every effort to make us work. When I think about the future, I don’t see an end I see us, all the way till the end of life. There’s this Telugu movie, “Amma Nana O Tamil Ammayi.” That’s all I want.</p>
    <p>And honestly… I hated Chennai in every way possible. I never thought I’d say this, but you completely changed how that city feels to me. It’s not that bad ugh, it’s actually good. Because it gave me you. I’ll be leaving a part of my heart there… with you.</p>
    <p>I trust you. I trust us. I know we’ll get through this, and one day we won’t have to live apart anymore. Until then, I know I’m going to miss you so much, baby girl.</p>
    <p>Always yours.<br>❤️</p>
